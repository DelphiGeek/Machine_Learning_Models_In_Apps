# XOR models

In this example, the [Keras](https://keras.io/) model is defined to train the XOR model for CoreML and TensorFlow Lite. You can find the trained models in the [models](./models) directory and because of the small size also in the respective projects. Execution is optional.

## Python setup

```sh
virtualenv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Jupyter Notebook

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

## Train the model with Python

```sh
python XOR.py
```
